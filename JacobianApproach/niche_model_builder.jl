# consumer–prey edge is converted into a *pairwise trophic interaction* with
# opposite signs (prey→predator +, predator→prey −) and rho-controlled magnitude
# correlation across directions. We ensure the directed graph is connected.

Simplest niche-model food web:
- Draw niche values n_i ~ U(0,1) and sort by n (higher niche eats lower niche).
- Draw a *feeding range length* r_i for each consumer from Beta-like control,
  modulated by degree-family weights to introduce out-degree heterogeneity.
- For each consumer i, choose a contiguous prey range on (0, n_i], place edges to
  all prey j whose niche falls in the chosen window.
- Convert each consumer–prey edge into a *pairwise antisymmetric* interaction:
  predator impact on prey: −m₁, prey impact on predator: +m₂ with |m₂| correlated
  to |m₁| via rho_sym (0 → independent magnitudes, 1 → identical magnitudes).
- Ensure no species is isolated and the directed graph is (weakly) connected by
  stitching minimal extra links if needed (nearest-niche neighbor).
